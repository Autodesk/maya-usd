/*! \brief Maya dependency node responsible for serializing unsaved Usd edits.

    In a pre-save or export callback, Maya will check if there are any proxy shapes of a supported
    type that have UsdStages with dirty Layers in them.  If stages are found, there are currently
    three options for how to handle the Usd edits:

    1. Save back to .usd files.
    There are three steps to handling this option.
    a) All anonymous layers must be saved to disk.  If a batch save delegate has been installed,
    and Maya is running in interactive mode, then a UI dialog can be displayed to provide a choice
    of file names and locations for all anonymous layers.  If Maya is not running in interactive
    mode, or there is no installed delegate to handle it, then Maya will automatically choose name
    and locations for all anonymous layers.
    b) All file-backed Usd layers will be saved.
    c) The Session Layer, if dirty, is handled as a special case.  It will be exported to a string
    and saved into the Maya file as an attribute on the LayerManager node.  When reading back in
    this file the Session Layer will be restored when recreating the Usd Stage.

    2. Save into the Maya file.
    With this option, if there are any Usd layers with unsaved edits, a single LayerManager
    node will be created that stores the Usd identifiers of all layers under the parent Proxy Shape
    as well as the dirty Usd layer itself exported to a string.  Dirty layers will include any
    anonymous layers, a Session layer with edits, and any file-backed Usd layers with edits that
   have not been saved to disk.

    3. Ignore all Usd edits.
    With this option, Maya will not attempt to save any dirty Usd layers, assuming the user is
    explicitly managing the state themselves.

    \note The LayerManager will only consider Usd stages that exist under a supported Proxy Shape
    class derived from MayaUsdProxyShapeBase and that has requested the support by adding the
    shapes MTypeId by calling LayerManager::addSupportForNodeType(MTypeId).
