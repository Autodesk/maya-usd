        // Now using a weak pointer instead of a referencing pointer.  The AL
        // plugin originally used a referencing pointer, but ran into problems.
        // From a Rob Bateman @ AL e-mail, 7-Apr-2019:
        // 
        // "The reason for the weak pointer was that we found that Maya seemed
        // to have a memory leak (as in, the MPxData derived objects were being
        // created, but never deleted when we expected them to be - possibly by
        // design?). We had originally used a direct mirror of the Pixar data
        // object, but because the data objects were never freed (even after
        // file new), the original stage would be retained. This meant the
        // internal SdfLayerCache in USD would keep hold of the previously
        // loaded layers. So we found we had this problem: 
        // 
        // 1. Import some.usda file into a proxy shape.
        // 2. Make some modifications
        // 3. File New
        // 4. Import the same "some.usda" file into a proxy shape.
        // 
        // At this point, USD would essentially hand you back the stage
        // composed of the modified layers, rather than a clean stage composed
        // from the files on disk. Switching the type from a shared_ptr to a
        // weak_ptr worked around this issue. Basically if we use a shared
        // pointer here, the only way to reload a scene, would be to restart
        // Maya."
