    // For example, there might be *no* rules at all for the path

    // rule would be "unloaded".

    // The case we need to explicitly handle is when the path is controlled
    // by a rule on itself or a descendent and not from an ancestor. Then we
    // need to duplicate the load or unload rule.

    // modified rules above. If not, add a specific rule that will give us
    // the desired behaviour.

    // The reason we don't simply add this specific rule for all cases and
    // avoid the above work is that sub-paths might have rules and we need
    // to preserve those rules. So we would need to do the above work anyway.
    //
    // Given that, a common case is that we don't need to add an additional
    // rule. Always adding it would add unnecessary rules.
    //
    // Note: the UsdStageLoadRules has a Minimize function that simplifies
    // rules, but we don't want to change rules the user might have set.

    // even though they are not currently used. As a general principle
