        messages so that it could reset itself when the scene was changed. This
        was intended to fire for new empty scenes or when opening a different
        scene file. It turns out Maya also emits that message during
        "Save Scene As..." operations, in which case we do *not* want to reset
        the batch renderer, as doing so would lead to a crash, since all of the
        proxy shapes are still in the DAG.

        This test ensures that the batch renderer does not reset and Maya does
        not crash when doing a "Save Scene As..." operation.

        the right time. With the former, the current scene may still be active
