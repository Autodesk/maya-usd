/// \brief  This is a transaction management class which provides interface for opening and closing multiple
///         transactions targeting any stage and layer.
///         It provides both direct interface used by Transaction class, which avoids stage lookup, as well
///         as static interface where stage needs to be provided.
///
///         Whenever a new transaction (first one targeting given layer) is opened an OpenNotice is being
///         emitted and snapshot of given layer is taken.
///         Whenever last transaction targeting given layer for given stage is closed, targetted layer content
///         is being compared against previously taken snapshot and CloseNotice is emitted with delta information.
///
/// \note   It's user responsibilty to pair Open with Close calls, otherwise clients might not respond to any 
///         further changes. As such it's advisable to prefer ScopedTransaction whenever possible.
