# Import and Export functionality

Supported Types
- Mesh 
- NurbsCurve
- Transforms (always exported)
- Camera (no special flags needed - will auto-detect cameras and export correctly)


## Import 

You can either use:
+ the command (AL_usdmaya_ImportCommand)
+ the maya "file" interface

Usage is as below (see Example Usages for Export)

Full set of supported import options are described [here](https://animallogic.github.io/AL_USDMaya/structAL_1_1usdmaya_1_1fileio_1_1ImporterParams.html)


## Export
Will export a part of your maya scene into the USD format for selected types

You can either use:
+ the command (AL_usdmaya_ExportCommand)
+ the maya "file" interface

If you want the export to happen from a certain point in the hierarchy then select the node in maya and pass the parameter selected=True, otherwise it will export from the root of the scene.

Full set of supported export options are described [here](https://animallogic.github.io/AL_USDMaya/structAL_1_1usdmaya_1_1fileio_1_1ExporterParams.html)


### Example Usage

Using File interface (also available from File->Export menu - File type is "al_usdmaya export"
```
file -force -options "Dynamic_Attributes=1;Meshes=1;Nurbs_Curves=1;Duplicate_Instances=1;Use_Animal_Schema=1;Merge_Transforms=1;Animation=1;Use_Timeline_Range=1;Frame_Min=1;Frame_Max=1;Filter_Sample=0;" -typ "AL usdmaya export" -es "/var/tmp/vv.usdc";
```

Command Examples
If you want to export everything keeping the time sampled data, you can do so by passing:
```
AL_usdmaya_ExportCommand -f "<path/to/out/file.usd>" -animation
```

Exporting attributes that are dynamic attributes can be done by:
```
AL_usdmaya_ExportCommand -f "<path/to/out/file.usd>" -dynamic
```

Exporting samples over a framerange can be done a few ways:
```
AL_usdmaya_ExportCommand -f "<path/to/out/file.usd>" -frameRange 0 24
AL_usdmaya_ExportCommand -f "<path/to/out/file.usd>" -ani
```

Nurbs curves can be exported by passing the corresponding parameters:
```
AL_usdmaya_ExportCommand -f "<path/to/out/file.usd>" -nc
```
  
The exporter can remove samples that contain the same data for adjacent samples
```
AL_usdmaya_ExportCommand -f "<path/to/out/file.usd>" -fs
```

#### Transform Merging, Instancing
The default behaviour of AL_USDMaya is to merge transforms and child shape nodes into a single Mesh on export,
which can be explicitly set:
```
AL_usdmaya_ExportCommand -f "<path/to/out/file.usd>" -mergeTransforms 1
```
If given the following maya heirarchy
```
--pSphere1
 --pSphere1Shape
```
this will be collapsed when exported as so:
```
def Mesh "pSphere1"
{
}
```
If you have multiple shapes under the transform, with "-mergeTransforms 1" you only get the first exportable shape exported 
and the type of the prim will be determined by the type of the shape.
With "-mergeTransforms 0", all shapes will still be exported.

By disabling the flag, transforms and child shape nodes can be exported separately, mirroring the Maya hierarchy:
```
AL_usdmaya_ExportCommand -f "<path/to/out/file.usd>" -mergeTransforms 0
```
Resulting in the following exported heirarchy, with some added metadata:
```
def Xform "pSphere1" (
  al_usdmaya_mergedTransform = "unmerged"
)
{
  def Mesh "foofoo"
  {
  }
}
```
Given following Maya instanced shapes hierarchy
```
--pSphere1 (transform)
 --pSphereShape1 (instanced mesh)
--pSphere2 (transform)
 --pSphereShape1 (instanced mesh)
--nurbsCircle1 (transform)
 --nurbsCircleShape1 (instanced curve)
--parentTransform (transform)
 --nurbsCircle2 (transform)
  --nurbsCircleShape1 (instanced curve)
```
By disabling both "mergeTransforms" and "duplicateInstances", these instanced shapes can be exported:
```
AL_usdmaya_ExportCommand -f "<path/to/out/file.usd>" -mergeTransforms 0 -duplicateInstances 0
```
Which will generate the following instanced structure within the exported USD file:
```
over "MayaExportedInstanceSources"
{
    def Xform "pSphere1"
    {
        def Mesh "pSphereShape1"
        {
        }
    }

    def Xform "nurbsCircle1"
    {
        def NurbsCurves "nurbsCircleShape1"
        {
        }
    }
}

def Xform "pSphere1" (
    al_usdmaya_mergedTransform = "unmerged"
    instanceable = true
    prepend references = </MayaExportedInstanceSources/pSphere1>
)
{
}

def Xform "pSphere2" (
    al_usdmaya_mergedTransform = "unmerged"
    instanceable = true
    prepend references = </MayaExportedInstanceSources/pSphere1>
)
{
    float3 xformOp:translate:translate = (0, 0, 5)
    uniform token[] xformOpOrder = ["xformOp:translate:translate"]
}

def Xform "nurbsCircle1" (
    al_usdmaya_mergedTransform = "unmerged"
    instanceable = true
    prepend references = </MayaExportedInstanceSources/nurbsCircle1>
)
{
    float3 xformOp:translate:translate = (5, 0, 0)
    uniform token[] xformOpOrder = ["xformOp:translate:translate"]
}

def Xform "parentTransform" (
    al_usdmaya_mergedTransform = "unmerged"
)
{
    def Xform "nurbsCircle2" (
        al_usdmaya_mergedTransform = "unmerged"
        instanceable = true
        prepend references = </MayaExportedInstanceSources/nurbsCircle1>
    )
    {
        float3 xformOp:translate:translate = (0, 0, 5)
        uniform token[] xformOpOrder = ["xformOp:translate:translate"]
    }
}
```
All geometry prims of instanced shapes are gathered under an override prim ```MayaExportedInstanceSources``` with USD hierarchy:
```
--Xform
 --Mesh/NurbsCurves
```
The name of ```Xform``` is generated by concatenating all parts of instanced shape's Maya dag path. It will be referenced by the ```Xform``` corresponding to direct Maya parent transform of instanced shape (See ```Xform "nurbsCircle2"``` in above example). ```instanceable=true``` enables USD Scenegraph instancing feature.

To bring instanced shapes back to Maya.
```
AL_usdmaya_ImportCommand -f "<path/to/out/file.usd>"
```
When "duplicateInstances" is disabled and "mergeTransforms" is on, exported USD file will look like:
```
over "MayaExportedInstanceSources"
{
    def Mesh "pSphere1_pSphereShape1"
    {
    }
    
    def NurbsCurves "nurbsCircle1_nurbsCircleShape1"
    {
    }
}

def Mesh "pSphere1" (
    prepend references = </MayaExportedInstanceSources/pSphere1_pSphereShape1>
)
{
}

def Mesh "pSphere2" (
    prepend references = </MayaExportedInstanceSources/pSphere1_pSphereShape1>
)
{
    float3 xformOp:translate:translate = (0, 0, 5)
    uniform token[] xformOpOrder = ["xformOp:translate:translate"]
}

def NurbsCurves "nurbsCircle1" (
    prepend references = </MayaExportedInstanceSources/nurbsCircle1_nurbsCircleShape1>
)
{
    float3 xformOp:translate:translate = (5, 0, 0)
    uniform token[] xformOpOrder = ["xformOp:translate:translate"]
}

def Xform "parentTransform"
{
    def NurbsCurves "nurbsCircle2" (
        prepend references = </MayaExportedInstanceSources/nurbsCircle1_nurbsCircleShape1>
    )
    {
        float3 xformOp:translate:translate = (0, 0, 5)
        uniform token[] xformOpOrder = ["xformOp:translate:translate"]
    }
}
```
Geometry prims sharing instanced shapes still reference the same source prim. USD doesn't support instancing on geometry prims, thus ```instanceable``` is not turned on.

### Animation Export
By default the exporter performs an extensive animation check on maya nodes such as transform, if any of common attributes like translate, rotate, scale and rotateOrder are connected as a target, we consider that attribute to be animated.

Use -aec/-extensiveAnimationCheck 0 to turn off this behavior (and just export everything as animated)
```
AL_usdmaya_ExportCommand -f "<path/to/out/file.usd>"  -eac 0 -ani
```

### Subsample Export
Use -ss or - subSamples to export sub-frame samples (defaults to 1 - 1 sample per frame)
```
AL_usdmaya_ExportCommand -f "<path/to/out/file.usd>"  -ss 2
```

## Mesh Export
For meshes normally we export:
1. Topology and Point Positions
2. Indexed UVs 
3. Colour Sets (by default RGBA and faceVarying)
4. Subdivision Edge and Vertex Creases
5. Dynamic Attributes

An option "meshUV" indicates AL_usdmaya_ExportCommand to only export Indexed UVs and leave other part of USD hierarchy as empty "over" prims. Under this mode, "leftHandedUV" is used to adjust UV indices orientation.

# Tech Note: Colours on Geometry
USD has an convention enforced in a Schema related to having a Colour Set on your mesh called "primvars:displayColor" [see here](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/blob/4a3f61e50fd862bfaa57b9a06b5f3d3c05c3bb09/pxr/usd/lib/usdGeom/gprim.h#L131).
This will be used as a fallback by Hydra and other viewers if there is no other shading information (There is also a matching displayOpacity)

To have geometry colours displayed by Hydra your data needs to look something like one of the 3 meshes in [this](../samples/colours/meshColours.usda) usd file.
Colour Data can be exported:
1. Per Vert
2. Per Face
3. Per Vert per Face (FaceVarying) Not 100% sure that this is either working or supported by Hydra

The exporter will export the data as it is stored in Maya - non-indexed


### How do we export in AL_USDMaya so we have colours?
1. Make sure that one of the colour sets in your mesh is called "displayColor" (there is an example maya file [here](../samples/colours/faceColours.ma))


### A note on Alembic+Maya+USD 

If I export to alembic from maya e.g
```
AbcExport -j "-root |pSphere1 -writeColorSets -f /var/tmp/colouredVerts.abc";
```
...where -wcs is "Write all color sets on MFnMeshes as color 3 or color 4 indexed geometry parameters with face varying scope".

Then I re-import I see the colours again in maya - great!

Looking at the alembic with abctree:
```
:--.childBnds
 :--statistics
 `--pSphere1
     | `--.xform
     `--pSphereShape1
         `--.geom
             :--.selfBnds
             :--P
             :--.faceIndices
             :--.faceCounts
             `--.arbGeomParams
                 `--colorSet1
                     :--.vals
                     `--.indices
```
shows there is an indexed colour set..

In the current version of the USD ABC Plugin(0.7.6) it looks like these indexed UV sets are correctly converted to Face-varying data...and display properly in the viewport (this was not working in older versions of USD)
