# Usage:
#   shebang shebang-str source.py dest.py
#   shebang file output.cmd
#
# The former substitutes '/pxrpythonsubst' in <source.py> with <shebang-str>
# and writes the result to <dest.py>.  The latter generates a file named
# <output.cmd> with the contents '@python "%~dp0<file>"';  this is a
# Windows command script to execute "python <file>" where <file> is in
# the same directory as the command script.
